**PyDev** is a trademark of **Appcelerator**. Although it's no longer
supported by Appcelerator, it's kept being developed (as open source)
by **Fabio Zadrozny** with financial support from the PyDev user community
and corporate sponsors.

**License: EPL (Eclipse Public License)**

See: `http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html <http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html>`_



Corporate sponsorship
-----------------------

PyDev is Open Source software and depends on contributions from its users
to remain financially viable. For companies that use PyDev, it's possible to financially
support it through corporate sponsorship.


How to become a corporate sponsor
----------------------------------

Sponsorship is available for all companies worldwide. The basic idea is that
a company finances the work on a particular feature of PyDev -- for which
a proper invoice is provided -- the code is done and is integrated in PyDev
under the EPL license.

That way the company gets its favorite missing feature, it's later kept supported
in the development mainline and everyone benefits from the work done.

All negotiations are kept strictly confidential. For inquiries, please contact:

fabioz.pydev at gmail.com.
